You and your neighbors receive the same services: police, fire, roads, schools - but you may be paying different property taxes to pay for those services.

The Senior Property Tax Credit allows property owners 62 and older to freeze their property tax assessment indefinitely. This program has cost the county $30 million in revenue in the first year of the program. That number will increase every year. 

Who makes up the difference? In my case, it's with a $2,000 increase in pre-k tuition. For everyone, it's with higher property taxes or smaller budgets for police, fire, roads, and schools.

The money must be going only to the disabled and poor seniors, right? Unfortunately, it's not. It's a reward for turning 62 at the expense of everyone else.

We can fix this.
