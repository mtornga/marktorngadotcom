# Microsoft Fabric Data Estate

Led enterprise BI modernization for Core & Main, a Fortune 500 waterworks distributor, building their data ecosystem on Microsoft Fabric from the ground up.

## The Challenge

A fragmented landscape of disconnected BI tools, spreadsheets, and manual processes. Analysts spending more time finding and preparing data than analyzing it. No single source of truth.

The goal: **Accelerate BI maturity by a decade in under two years.**

## What We Built

### Unified Data Platform

Migrated disparate data sources into a cohesive Microsoft Fabric lakehouse architecture:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from D365 Finance & Operations, legacy systems, and external sources
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, validated, and enriched datasets with consistent schemas
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready analytics tables optimized for Power BI consumption

### D365 Finance & Operations Integration

The most complex integration challenge: 200+ tables from Microsoft's ERP system.

- Deep-dive research into D365 data models and relationships
- Built PySpark pipelines for incremental data extraction
- Implemented change data capture for near-real-time updates
- Created semantic models mapping ERP concepts to business terminology

### Self-Service Analytics

Enabled hundreds of analysts to self-serve governed data:

- Semantic models with row-level security
- Certified Power BI datasets
- Data catalog with business glossary
- Training programs for self-service reporting

## Technical Stack

- **Platform**: Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouse, Data Factory, Power BI)
- **Processing**: PySpark, Dataflows Gen2
- **Source Systems**: D365 Finance & Operations, legacy databases, Excel
- **Governance**: Purview integration, RLS, certification workflows
- **Orchestration**: Fabric pipelines with dependency management

## Impact

- Consolidated 15+ disconnected data sources into unified lakehouse
- Reduced report development time from weeks to days
- Enabled C-suite dashboards with trusted, governed metrics
- Built foundation for AI/ML initiatives (see other projects)

## Lessons Learned

Enterprise data modernization isn't just technical—it's organizational change. The hardest part wasn't building pipelines; it was getting stakeholders aligned on definitions, governance, and ownership.

**Key insight**: Start with high-visibility quick wins to build momentum, then tackle the complex integrations once you've established credibility.
