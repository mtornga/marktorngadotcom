# DeerAI Tracking Response

A wildlife management platform that transforms property protection through spatial intelligence. Built to detect, track, and deter deer and other animals using computer vision, Kalman filtering, and autonomous ground vehicles.

## The Challenge

Property owners face constant wildlife intrusion damaging gardens, crops, and landscaping. Traditional deterrents are static and ineffective. Animals quickly learn to ignore them.

The solution? **Dynamic, intelligent response.**

## System Architecture

### Spatial Intelligence Pipeline

1. **Detection** → MegaDetector v5 & custom YOLOv8n models identify wildlife in each frame
2. **Tracking** → Kalman filter + appearance embeddings maintain identity across occlusions
3. **Localization** → AprilTag homography converts pixel coordinates to real-world positions (feet)
4. **Behavior Analysis** → Classify posture, speed, direction, and intent
5. **Trajectory Forecasting** → Predict paths and route deterrent systems

### Dual-Environment Development

**Indoor Tabletop (Rapid Iteration)**
- 24"×30" test environment with Wyze v2 + Reolink E1 cameras
- CuteBot Pro unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)
- AprilTag calibration for precision coordinate mapping
- Iterate detection, tracking, and routing algorithms safely

**Outdoor Production**
- 4-5 Reolink cameras covering property perimeter
- Real-time RTSP stream processing
- GPU-accelerated inference on Ubuntu server (GTX 3080)
- Coordinate mapping across entire property

## Technical Stack

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLO, MegaDetector v5
- **Tracking**: Kalman filtering, Hungarian algorithm, MegaDescriptor embeddings
- **Cameras**: Wyze v2, Reolink E1 Zoom, Reolink Duo 3 PoE
- **Robotics**: CuteBot Pro (Micro:bit v2), custom BLE control
- **Infrastructure**: AWS S3, Samba shared storage, tmux monitoring dashboards
- **Calibration**: AprilTags (tag36h11 family)

## Key Features

### Real-Time Detection & Tracking
MegaDetector provides robust animal detection. Custom YOLOv8n models fine-tuned for local species and lighting conditions. Appearance embeddings ensure consistent ID across frames even with occlusions.

### Precision Localization
AprilTag-based homography transforms camera pixels into yard coordinates (x_ft, y_ft). Know exactly where animals are, not just what they look like.

### Autonomous Response
Route UGVs to intercept predicted trajectories. Activate targeted deterrents (lights, sound, motion) exactly when and where needed.

### Continuous Retraining Loop
Drop new footage into the pipeline. Auto-generate draft labels. Correct and retrain. Quality gates enforce AP50, recall, and latency thresholds before deployment.

## Workflow

```bash
# Data ingestion
make frames       # Extract frames from raw clips
make autolabel    # Generate YOLO draft labels
make qc           # Validate dataset integrity
make split        # Train/val/test splits

# Training & evaluation
make train        # YOLOv8n with locked hyperparameters
make eval         # Metrics + pytest quality gates

# Deployment
make export       # ONNX/TorchScript for edge inference
```

## Inspiration

Based on the University of Minnesota's **"Geofenced Unmanned Aerial Robotic Defender for Deer Detection and Deterrence (GUARD)"** research. Adapted for ground-based systems with enhanced tracking and behavior analysis.

## Current Status

**Active development.** Indoor tabletop system operational with functional detection, tracking, and UGV routing. Outdoor deployment in progress with multi-camera calibration and deterrent integration.

## What's Next

- Multi-target trajectory prediction
- Behavior state classification (grazing, alert, fleeing)
- Coordinated multi-UGV swarm control
- Event highlight reels with automated video generation
- Integration with smart home systems (HomeKit, Home Assistant)
