# Cybersecurity Risk Dashboard

Built a board-level cybersecurity metrics dashboard for a $16 billion insurance company, consolidating fragmented security data into actionable executive insights.

## The Challenge

The CISO needed to report cybersecurity posture to the board quarterly. The problem: security data lived in 16 different systems with no unified view.

**The Ask**: One dashboard. 22 metrics. Board-ready visualizations. Quarterly refresh.

**The Reality**: Data scattered across SIEM, vulnerability scanners, identity management, endpoint protection, email security, and more. No consistent schemas. No data warehouse. No existing ETL.

## Solution Architecture

### Data Integration Layer

Built a lightweight data integration pipeline connecting 16 source systems:

- **Security Tools**: Splunk, Qualys, CrowdStrike, Proofpoint, Okta
- **IT Systems**: ServiceNow, Active Directory, asset management
- **External Sources**: Threat intelligence feeds, industry benchmarks

Each source required custom extraction logic—APIs where available, database queries where not, manual exports as last resort.

### Metrics Framework

Collaborated with security leadership to define 22 KPIs across five domains:

1. **Threat Detection**: Time-to-detect, alert volume, false positive rate
2. **Vulnerability Management**: Patch compliance, critical vuln aging, scan coverage
3. **Identity & Access**: MFA adoption, privileged account monitoring, access reviews
4. **Endpoint Security**: Agent coverage, encryption compliance, malware incidents
5. **Security Operations**: Incident response times, ticket backlog, training completion

Each metric included:
- Current value with trend indicator
- Target threshold (red/yellow/green)
- Drill-down capability for investigation
- Historical context (quarter-over-quarter)

### Visualization Design

Board members have 5 minutes per topic. The dashboard needed to answer:

1. **Are we secure?** (Overall risk score)
2. **What's changed?** (Trending metrics)
3. **What needs attention?** (Red/yellow KPIs)

Design principles:
- Executive summary on first page
- Domain deep-dives on subsequent pages
- No jargon—translate technical metrics to business impact
- Consistent color coding across all visualizations

## Technical Implementation

- **Platform**: Tableau Server with scheduled extracts
- **Data Prep**: Tableau Prep flows for transformation logic
- **Security**: Row-level filtering, SSO integration, audit logging
- **Distribution**: Scheduled PDF exports for board packets

## Delivery Challenges

### Data Quality

The biggest obstacle wasn't technical—it was data quality. Security tools often had:
- Missing timestamps
- Inconsistent asset identifiers
- Duplicate records
- Gaps in historical data

Solution: Built data quality scorecards so stakeholders understood limitations. "This metric reflects 87% of endpoints" is better than pretending it's 100%.

### Stakeholder Alignment

Different teams had different definitions of "incident" and "vulnerability." Spent significant time building consensus on metric definitions before touching any data.

### Refresh Cadence

Quarterly board reporting but daily operational needs. Built two versions:
- Board deck: Quarterly refresh, curated narrative
- Operations view: Daily refresh, all metrics, self-service filters

## Impact

- **Time Savings**: 40+ hours per quarter previously spent manually compiling reports
- **Visibility**: First unified view of security posture across the organization
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership for each metric domain
- **Board Confidence**: Consistent, professional reporting elevated security conversations

## Lessons Learned

Executive dashboards aren't about showing all the data. They're about telling a story with data. The 22 metrics we chose mattered less than the narrative they enabled.
