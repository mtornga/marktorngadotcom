This was my first experiment with automated timelapse photography using a Raspberry Pi. Watching the amaryllis bloom over several days, compressed into a few seconds, reveals the hidden motion of plant growth that we normally can't perceive.

This project kicked off my interest in automated capture systems, which eventually led to more sophisticated setups like the sky timelapse project that followed.
