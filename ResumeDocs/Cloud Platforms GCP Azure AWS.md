In Google Cloud Platform I:
	•	Used GCP Pub/Sub to publish and subscribe to topics for the purpose of creating event-driven data pipelines
	•	Used Cloud Functions to create low-cost serverless data analysis pipelines with Python and Go
	•	Used IAM extensively to manage resources, permissions, and service account access
	•	Used GCP BigQuery to analyze BigQuery spend by identifying frequent and long-running queries.
	•	Used Secret Manager to create secure processes
	•	Used GitHub Actions, wrote YAML, to interact with GCP to query BigQuery and log to new and existing BigQuery tables. Used api scopes and the full security features of GitHub and GCP to secure the interactions. In GitHub actions pulled a docker container image from GCP Artifact Registry securely.
	•	Use of Dataplex for automating the process of registering resource metadata and creating backups in JSON.
