 Experience


Core & Main | St. Louis, MO

Manager, Data Analytics | 2023 - 2025
	•	Enterprise Data Strategy & Modernization: Led the build-out of Core & Main’s enterprise BI and data ecosystem, migrating from fragmented tools into a Microsoft Fabric–based data estate with governed semantic models. Delivered consistent, trusted analytics across multiple ERPs—including Microsoft D365 Finance & Operations—accelerating BI maturity by a decade in under two years.
	•	Microsoft D365 Finance & Operations Integration: Used the D365 F&O user interface and Argano’s AOT Browser to map forms, entities, and SQL logic to underlying system tables. Manually researched and added over 200 D365 tables into Synapse Link for replication to Azure Data Lake, expanding analytics coverage across Finance, Supply Chain, and Operations.
	•	Fabric Lakehouse Engineering: Transformed raw (“bronze”) D365 system tables into SQL-friendly Silver layer tables using PySpark in Fabric notebooks, then reverse-engineered D365 business logic to create Gold layer topic tables such as InvoiceLine, InventoryOnHand, and PurchaseOrderHeader.
	•	Multi-ERP Data Unification: Built Master layer tables in the Enterprise Data Warehouse combining D365 and legacy ERP data into unified topics (InvoiceLine, PurchaseOrder, Inventory, etc.), enabling total-company reporting and consistent KPIs across platforms.
	•	Reporting & Visualization Leadership: Partnered with D365 developers and business stakeholders to design dozens of Power BI reports and dashboards that met accounting, audit, credit, operations, and management needs not addressed by native D365 reporting tools.
	•	Governance & Compliance: Established enterprise-wide governance frameworks to standardize metrics and data definitions across Finance, Operations, and Sales. Partnered with CFO and CIO to decommission redundant tools (Alteryx, ThoughtSpot) and enforce single-source-of-truth data stewardship practices aligned to SOX requirements.
	•	Azure Cost Optimization & Scalability: Architected and operationalized Fabric Lakehouses on Azure with cost-per-click reporting to align compute spend with user adoption, ensuring scalability and fiscal accountability as usage grew post-ERP migration.
	•	Executive & Cross-Functional Partnership: Collaborated directly with C-suite leaders to define data strategy and deliver reporting that drove decisions across Finance, Operations, and Sales. Enabled hundreds of analysts and managers to self-serve governed data through multi-ERP semantic models and role-based Power BI access.
	•	Data Literacy & Culture Building: Delivered enterprise-wide training in Power BI and analytics best practices, elevating data fluency and adoption across hundreds of employees.

Feedback

Client Lead @ Slalom

“I know the last couple of weeks have been a bit of a grind but you have absolutely crushed it on the [removed] Security Dashboard project. To develop a board level presentation for a $15B company in two weeks, that is focused on subject matter that you were unfamiliar with, is no small feat. You have gained the trust and respect of everyone you have worked with while also expanding your own understanding of a very complex situation and organization. You value and demonstrate clear communication, effective collaboration and hard work, all of which will enable our success on this project.” 

Senior Principal @ Slalom

“Mark was instrumental to the work done on the [removed] Batch Analytics project, and he was the primary driver for the additional extension requested by the client to continue his work. Time and time again Mark showed up to client meetings, navigated the complex business challenges, and drove the conversations to a meaningful outcome. 

The client landscape wasn’t simple, and the expectations for Slalom were high. Mark constantly adapted to the changing landscape and was always willing to meet the client where they were, with the challenges they had, and offer solutions. Many conversations started out with an unknown difficult problem, and I saw Mark take charge and lead the conversation to an actionable resolution. Despite the continual increased scope from the client, Mark’s attitude was always one for trying to provide solutions and meeting the client where they were. I heard him frequently mention things like, “I’ve been where they are, and it sucks. They’re just trying to get out from being buried in their problems”, and then go forward and work like crazy to help out these teams.

By the end of the engagement, one of our toughest stakeholders was willing to give up their trusted databases, reports, and processes they had prior been used to, and instead adopt all the work Mark developed; All during a challenging period where their team was buried in more work than ever before. Many people had expressed that this client was difficult to work with, but by the end the stakeholder was saying things like, “I wish we were able to keep Mark around a little longer”, and “[to the client’s internal team] Are you sure you guys are going to be able to continue his [Mark’s] work? And in the same timeline?”. Even that individual’s boss (the VP) was expressing “This was great. I wish we had enough funding to keep you around even longer”.

We were able to directly see the impact of Mark's work over the last few months in the number of open 'NQ Pend' service tickets. We were able to watch this team's backlog shrink from 23,000 active daily backlog tickets all the way down to 8k. To quote the client again, ‘I don't think we could have ever gotten out from underneath these without this work’.” 

Solution Owner @ Slalom

“To steal from [client lead]’s words, Mark is a “true professional”, which to me means that he is responsible, a self-starter, and an expert in his field. During the BI Rationalization project at [removed], he was able to flex in training facilitation, dashboard rebuild, and he made an impact with the Tableau Admin group. He is calm and confident when asked questions and presents material naturally and with ease.  His ability to answer questions made him a favorite of a few of our most inquisitive client employees. He is a great team member and is always willing to help someone else when they run into challenges in Tableau design. I am going to miss the humor and intellect that he brought to our team.” 

Global Partner Alliance Manager @ Slalom

“This July, Slalom executed a weeklong analytics webinar for one of the leading companies in STL and all of Slalom, [removed]. Originally the webinar attendance goal was approximately 50, however, over 420 unique individuals (and 350 each day minimum) attended. Mark led this endeavor in tight partnership with the client and Tableau.

As a result of these efforts, demand for analytics and data visualization using Tableau is growing exponentially, millions will be saved in licensing and other costs, and the client is beginning to get more value from its data.”   

Senior Delivery Principal @ Slalom

“I had the chance to work with Mark at [removed] for the first 4 months of 2020. It was one of the most positive experiences I’ve had at Slalom.

What stands out most about Mark is his poise in tough situations. On more than one occasion during a late night deployment, something went wrong. As we worked through solution after solution and the frustration grew, Mark was always a voice of calm. His composure under pressure translated into client confidence in Slalom’s work. We delivered better because of Mark.

Mark is someone who puts people first. I would be hard pressed to try to count the number of times I saw him reach out to team members to help them learn and grow technically and professionally. He is also quick to give thoughtful feedback in a disarming, polite way. It’s obvious working with Mark how much he cares about helping others.

And this all says nothing of his technical skills. I’m comfortable saying there is not a problem you could put in front of Mark that he couldn’t figure out. He learned Ansible in the course of delivering on a SOW which we sold based on our ability to use Ansible!

If I were putting together a team for a D&A project, there’s no question I’d want it to include Mark.”
