I made it through 3 rounds of interviews at the airflow managed service vendor Astronomer.ai famous for having the CEO caught cheating on his wife at a Coldplay concert. This includes making it through the technical interview. The final interview was a demo where I showed how I used Airflow to maximize the compute utilization of servers. It was well received. I got the offer but i didn’t want to be a Field Engineer the way they defined the role.
