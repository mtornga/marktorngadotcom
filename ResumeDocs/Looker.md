In 2019 I used Looker at Mastercard as part of a Data as a Service project. We basically only used Looker for the data modeling and the API endpoint and served the data through a custom UI, starting with an nginx-hosted swagger doc. But my claim to fame on Looker is that there was a field available in the UI that wasn’t coming through in the API. I submitted a request to the software vendor and they updated the API globally to accommodate me. I altered the product to make progress on my project!
