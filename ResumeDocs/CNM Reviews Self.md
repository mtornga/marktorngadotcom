	•	1. Accuracy & Timeliness - Meet service level standards for accuracy and timeliness. Communicating within 24-48 hours for any requests. Keep tasks organized / documented and assign due date on all items. Communicate to customer with deadline is no longer attainable. 
	•	Maintain a high level of accuracy over all deliverables. Constantly revisit the review process using a risk-based approach, ensuring each deliverable under goes an appropriate level of scrutiny in order to avoid errors or restatements. Ensure all reporting is consistent with FP&A reporting guidelines. 
	•	I have overall increased timeliness and accuracy in the Finance inbox by cross-training the team and creating a knowledge base to speed up our responses. By rotating inbox responsibilities, we have more people who can answer any question that comes in. We have had many days of “inbox zero” despite the all-time high volume of unique subjects/emailers/messages in the inbox.
	•	Organization and documentation have also been improved through the introduction of Azure DevOps to track our capacity and tasks. The feedback from the team has been positive. They appreciate that their capacity is considered and that we take time to scope and discuss each task before starting. This also gives them a place to take notes and helps them be accountable to themselves, me, and the rest of the team.
	•	Brandon, Tyler, and Katie all participate in peer reviewing the outputs of the new team members.2. Administer and improve all data platforms / tools. Sales Insight, ThoughtSpot and Alteryx. Understand underlying data and security and how the data integrates with other systems. Evaluate data analytics, self service tool (i.e., PowerBI) to eliminate routine reporting and simplify ad hoc reporting. Once tool is declared, develop, communicate and execute strategy for new tool to all customers.
	•	Own all data related user groups / committees, Alteryx, Data Committee, etc. 
	•	Administration of all the tools has improved.
	•	Alteryx – increased the quality of content in Alteryx User Group and helped other groups step up to contribute content. Developed and implemented Alteryx Error Bot to alert in Teams when a scheduled workflow fails, solving a previous blind spot. Made the Alteryx Server job history transparent to more users. Prompted IT to restart the server when memory utilization was too high and to delete unneeded files to free up disk space. Identified long-running workflows from the Pricing team and reduced the run-time of one of their workflows from an hour to 4 minutes through SQL work. Backed-up all workflow content using a custom utility I developed. Documented and shared with Alteryx User Group all of the available Gallery Connections that users can request access to.
	•	ThoughtSpot – Worked with IT and Brandon to successfully migrate from the on-premises ThoughtSpot deployment to ThoughtSpot Cloud, saving $3k/mo in server costs. Submitted a ticket to ThoughtSpot about data missing from their API, which seems to have caused them to fix it in the latest update to their cloud product. This enabled us (and every other company!) to programmatically retrieve the Scheduled Send results and recipient lists to better track who is getting value out of ThoughtSpot. Took ownership of the ThoughtSpot SSO TAP Group.
	•	Developed an improved usage tracking dashboard for ThoughtSpot/SIP/R2W/FinanceInbox in Power BI that incorporates the employee directory that allows us for the first time to look at usage by region and job title. The SIP portion has been demoed to Innovation and will replace their current SIP usage statistics on the intranet. The R2W portion has been demoed to IR and they will start using in place of their current process. It also helps us understand usage so that we can better prepare for Leap distributions and for potentially decomming SIP and ThoughtSpot.
	•	Worked with IT to get my group the first non-IT non-Super User access to Azure Synapse Dev/Prod. Brought in Gabe to do the EDW re-orientation for the team which has helped us make the EDW our first choice of data sources and help future-proof our work.Documented knowledge of systems, integrations, and tools in the https://coreandmain.sharepoint.com/sites/DataAnalyticsDataWiki (we are copying up the OneNote material here bit by bit).
	•	3. Create a new Center of Excellence Data Analytics team. Build the team’s knowledge of data and the business. Design and lead through robust Alteryx/RPA project to streamline processes for other departments like Credit, Accounting, Internal Audit, Sourcing, etc. Streamline the Ad Hoc request process. Develop and adhere to SLA. Build proactive relationships with our “customers”. Reach out to them on a determined cadence to see what tools and reporting they are using, what they are doing manually and what their needs are (Sourcing, Pricing, Audit, Stacey G, etc). Help organize and build out Data Warehouse. Ensure we are ready for a modern erp. Invest in training and development of emerging technologies such as AI/ChatGBT to further enhance automation and insights.  
	•	The Data Warehouse has been built out more in the past 5 months than in the past two years. We are well on our way to supporting our Power BI reporting strategy with the EDW rather than relying on Alteryx as an intermediate step. I presented about the EDW to the Alteryx User Group.
	•	We have a regular sync between DA and the Innovation team to check on what they are building and also check whether our customers’ requests should be part of a larger Innovation initiative. We have started doing this with Initiatives as well. We met with Incentive Comp to help them with various Alteryx and data management topics.We have completed automation projects this year for Credit, Accounting, Audit, Tax, Pricing and others. We are in the process of meeting with many groups on the Modern ERP reporting topic, which helps us better understand their reports and tooling.
	•	ChatGPT – Led the team in a workshop to use ChatGPT to write python for an automation project. As a result, Hannah used her learnings to use ChatGPT to optimize a SQL query by 90%+. I have WIP material to share in a LnL or other setting soon.I'll be presenting on our systems and data sources at the Feb 7 Lunch N Learn.Modern ERP - I have been active there, helping push along my counterparts to get to a decision on the Data Migration Service and get that started. Katie has provided 20 or so reports to Kay Rouzer to help with Leap. I have been doing the Data Committee updates on the subject so far.
	•	4. Personal Development - continue to focus on personal growth as it relates to being our data leader, attend applicable trainings & conferences, research best techniques, work with internal subject matter experts to better understanding CNM data. Work towards becoming an undisputed data expert. Continue to discuss development with manager. 
	•	I’m always growing 😄.
	•	5. Team Development – Provide learning and development for all team members to ensure the team is developing and enjoying what they do. Empower the team to take more ownership over their tasks. Determine what motivates each team member, provide inspiration. Ensure high levels of engagement and retention. Delegate all routine tasks to your team members to ensure you have time for strategy and higher level analysis. Prioritize tasks / projects to ensure we are getting the best return for our time. Ensure team understands the importance of proper organization and documentation. Evaluate to ensure we have the right resources that can support our priorities. Lead onboarding all new team members. 
	•	Weekly 1:1s have been important to team development, as have our in-person workshops. Showing up every day with enthusiasm, optimism, and focus is important as well. Attitude starts at the top and I want them to be excited about the opportunities in their work.
	•	Hiring Mark and Ben ranks amongst my best accomplishments this year. They are flourishing and bring unique and much-needed skills to the team.
	•	I have stayed out of the weeds, especially since Katie started. Everything is delegated and prioritized. I work 1:1 with anyone who is struggling with an assigned task.The Josh Jenkins PIP process was a delicate situation and emotionally difficult. I think I guided it to the optimal outcome where everyone retained their dignity. Josh was motivated to try hard at his PIP but also nudged into seeking alternate employment, which is the win-win-win outcome. The team did not know about the PIP. Helping bring back Katie, retaining Tyler, and conducting 15+ interviews to find two great people and one hopefully great one were all challenges on top of my normal workload.

	•	Building organizational talent is my strongest category of the first 8 months. I'm also proud of my leadership and instinct to challenge the status quo. I have built collaborative relationships with a few groups and contacts at many more. Business acumen remains my biggest growth area! When Grant arrives, we'll do more site visits. Leap will probably put me in closer contact with the day-to-day of the business.
