My claim to fame in Alteryx is that I created an alteryx workflow that accesses Alteryx’s MongoDB and its web server to download every workflow on your alteryx Gallery/Server. I called this utility ServerRipper and uploaded it to the Alteryx Community forums. This backup feature was a pain point for Gallery Admins and my utility filled the gap. The claim to fame in here is that after a few years Alteryx changed the API version, breaking my utility, but the alteryx employees put a new post on the Community forums that said “here’s a new version of ServerRipper based on Mark Tornga’s solution that supports the new API”. My backup utility is in the DNA of the official backup utility for the software!
