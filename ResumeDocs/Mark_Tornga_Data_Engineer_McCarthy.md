COLLEAGUE & CLIENT FEEDBACK
 "You absolutely crushed it on the Security Dashboard project. To develop a board-level presentation for a $15B company in two
weeks, focused on subject matter you were unfamiliar with, is no small feat. You earned the trust and respect of everyone you
worked with while expanding your understanding of a complex situation and organization."
— Senior Delivery Principal @ Slalom
"Mark constantly adapted to a complex and shifting landscape, always meeting the client where they were and steering
conversations to actionable outcomes. By the end of the engagement, one of our toughest stakeholders was saying, 'I wish we
were able to keep Mark around a little longer.' We watched the team's backlog shrink from 23,000 active tickets all the way down
to 8,000. The client said, 'I don't think we could have ever gotten out from underneath these without this work.'"
— Senior Consultant Lead @ Slalom
"Mark is a 'true professional'—responsible, a self-starter, and an expert in his field. He is calm and confident when asked
questions and presents material naturally and with ease. His ability to answer questions made him a favorite of our most
inquisitive client employees. I am going to miss the humor and intellect that he brought to our team."
— Solution Owner @ Slalom
"Mark shows rare poise in tough situations. During late-night deployments, something went wrong and as frustration grew, Mark
was always a voice of calm. His composure under pressure translated into client confidence in Slalom's work. We delivered better
because of Mark."
— Senior Delivery Principal @ Slalom
"One of the most positive experiences I've had at Slalom. I'm comfortable saying there is not a problem you could put in front of
Mark that he couldn't figure out. He learned Ansible in the course of delivering on a SOW which we sold based on our ability to
use Ansible! If I were putting together a team for a D&A; project, there's no question I'd want it to include Mark."
— Senior Architect @ Slalom
"Mark and his team have successfully delivered six AI projects, becoming early adopters and educators in the field. His technical
acumen and leadership have been instrumental in our Power BI rollout."
— Vice President of Finance @ Core & Main
"Mark quickly became a trusted leader and partner. His strong technical skills, strategic mindset, and ability to learn systems
rapidly enabled immediate impact. He delivers at a high level with little guidance."
— Vice President of Finance @ Core & Main
"Mark's ability to take on unfamiliar technologies—NiFi, Looker APIs, Swagger, security protocols—and become productive
almost immediately is remarkable. His curiosity and adaptability set him apart."
— Lead Engineer @ Mastercard
"Mark is someone who puts people first. He goes out of his way to help teammates grow technically and professionally, and does
so with kindness, humor, and humility."
— Senior Delivery Principal @ Slalom
"Feedback from the VP, CISO, and IT Leadership during our dashboard demo: 'I think this is awesome.' 'Impressive.' 'I'm blown
away.' 'I could see this going in the board deck.' 'This is really impressive.'"
— VP, CISO & IT Leadership @ RGA
