“I

the
 
last
 
couple
 
of
 
weeks
 
have
 
been
 
a

To

that

that
 
you

is

“Mark
 
was
 
instrumental
 
to
 
the
 
work
 
done
 
on
 
the
 
[removed]
 
Batch
 
Analytics
 
project,
 
and
 
he
 
was
 
the
 
primary
 
driver
 
for
 
the
 
additional
 
extension
 
requested
 
by
 
the
 
client
 
to
 
continue
 
his
 
work.
 
Time
 
and
 
time
 
again
 
Mark
 
showed
 
up
 
to
 
client
 
meetings,
 
navigated
 
the
 
complex
 
business
 
challenges,
 
and
 
drove
 
the
 
conversations
 
to
 
a
 
meaningful
 
outcome.
 
 
 
The
 
client
 
landscape
 
wasn’t
 
simple,
 
and
 
the
 
expectations
 
for
 
Slalom
 
were
 
high.
 
Mark
 
constantly
 
adapted
 
to
 
the
 
changing
 
landscape
 
and
 
was
 
always
 
willing
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
client
 
where
 
they
 
were,
 
with
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
had,
 
and
 
offer
 
solutions.
 
Many
 
conversations
 
started
 
out
 
with
 
an
 
unknown
 
difﬁcult
 
problem,
 
and
 
I
 
saw
 
Mark
 
take
 
charge
 
and
 
lead
 
the
 
conversation
 
to
 
an
 
actionable
 
resolution.
 
Despite
 
the
 
continual
 
increased
 
scope
 
from
 
the
 
client,
 
Mark’s
 
attitude
 
was
 
always
 
one
 
for
 
trying
 
to
 
provide
 
solutions
 
and
 
meeting
 
the
 
client
 
where
 
they
 
were.
 
I
 
heard
 
him
 
frequently
 
mention
 
things
 
like,
 
“I’ve
 
been
 
where
 
they
 
are,
 
and
 
it
 
sucks.
 
They’re
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
out
 
from
 
being
 
buried
 
in
 
their
 
problems”,
 
and
 
then
 
go
 
forward
 
and
 
work
 
like
 
crazy
 
to
 
help
 
out
 
these
 
teams.
 
 
By
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
engagement,
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
toughest
 
stakeholders
 
was
 
willing
 
to
 
give
 
up
 
their
 
trusted
 
databases,
 
reports,
 
and
 
processes
 
they
 
had
 
prior
 
been
 
used
 
to,
 
and
 
instead
 
adopt
 
all
 
the
 
work
 
Mark
 
developed;
 
All
 
during
 
a
 
challenging
 
period
 
where
 
their
 
team
 
was
 
buried
 
in
 
more
 
work
 
than
 
ever
 
before.
 
Many
 
people
 
had
 
expressed
 
that
 
this
 
client
 
was
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
work
 
with,
 
but
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
the
 
stakeholder
 
was
 
saying
 
things
 
like,
 
“I
 
wish
 
we
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
Mark
 
around
 
a
 
little
 
longer”,
 
and
 
“[to
 
the
 
client’s
 
internal
 
team]
 
Are
 
you
 
sure
 
you
 
guys
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
continue
 
his
 
[Mark’s]
 
work?
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
timeline?”.
 
Even
 
that
 
individual’s
 
boss
 
(the
 
VP)
 
was
 
expressing
 
“This
 
was
 
great.
 
I
 
wish
 
we
 
had
 
enough
 
funding
 
to
 
keep
 
you
 
around
 
even
 
longer”.
 
 
We
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
directly
 
see
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
Mark's
 
work
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
months
 
in
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
open
 
'NQ
 
Pend'
 
service
 
tickets.
 
We
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
watch
 
this
 
team's
 
backlog
 
shrink
 
from
 
23,000
 
active
 
daily
 
backlog
 
tickets
 
all
 
the
 
way
 
down
 
to
 
8k.
 
To
 
quote
 
the
 
client
 
again,
 
‘I
 
don't
 
think
 
we
 
could
 
have
 
ever
 
gotten
 
out
 
from
 
underneath
 
these
 
without

from
 
[client
 
lead]’s
 
words,
 
Mark
 
is
 
a
 
“true
 
professional”,
 
which
 
to
 
me
 
means
 
that
 
he
 
is
 
responsible,
 
a
 
self-starter,
 
and
 
an
 
expert
 
in
 
his
 
ﬁeld.
 
During
 
the
 
BI
 
Rationalization
 
project
 
at
 
[removed],
 
he
 
was
 
able
 
to
 
ﬂex
 
in
 
training
 
facilitation,
 
dashboard
 
rebuild,
 
and
 
he
 
made
 
an
 
impact
 
with
 
the
 
Tableau
 
Admin
 
group.
 
He
 
is
 
calm
 
and
 
conﬁdent
 
when
 
asked
 
questions
 
and
 
presents
 
material
 
naturally
 
and
 
with
 
ease.
  
His
 
ability
 
to
 
answer
 
questions
 
made
 
him
 
a
 
favorite
 
of
 
a
 
few
 
of
 
our
 
most
 
inquisitive
 
client
 
employees.
 
He
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
team
 
member
 
and
 
is
 
always
 
willing
 
to
 
help
 
someone
 
else
 
when
 
they
 
run
 
into
 
challenges
 
in
 
Tableau
 
design.
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
miss
 
the
 
humor
 
and
 
intellect
 
that
 
he
 
brought
 
to
 
our
 
team.”

“This
 
July,
 
Slalom
 
executed
 
a
 
weeklong
 
analytics
 
webinar
 
for
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
leading
 
companies
 
in
 
STL
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
Slalom,
 
[removed].
 
Originally
 
the
 
webinar
 
attendance
 
goal
 
was
 
approximately
 
50,
 
however,
 
over
 
420
 
unique
 
individuals
 
(and
 
350
 
each
 
day
 
minimum)
 
attended.
 
Mark
 
led
 
this
 
endeavor
 
in
 
tight
 
partnership
 
with
 
the
 
client
 
and
 
Tableau.
 
 
As
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
these
 
efforts,
 
demand
 
for
 
analytics
 
and
 
data
 
visualization
 
using
 
Tableau
 
is
 
growing
 
exponentially,
 
millions
 
will
 
be
 
saved
 
in
 
licensing
 
and
 
other
 
costs,
 
and
 
the
 
client
 
is
 
beginning
 
to
 
get
 
more
 
value
 
from
 
its
 
data.”

“I
 
had
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
Mark
 
at
 
[removed]
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
4
 
months
 
of
 
2020.
 
It
 
was
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
positive
 
experiences
 
I’ve
 
had
 
at
 
Slalom.
 
 
What
 
stands
 
out
 
most
 
about
 
Mark
 
is
 
his
 
poise
 
in
 
tough
 
situations.
 
On
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
occasion
 
during
 
a
 
late
 
night
 
deployment,
 
something
 
went
 
wrong.
 
As
 
we
 
worked
 
through
 
solution
 
after
 
solution
 
and
 
the
 
frustration
 
grew,
 
Mark
 
was
 
always
 
a
 
voice
 
of
 
calm.
 
His
 
composure
 
under
 
pressure
 
translated
 
into
 
client
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
Slalom’s
 
work.
 
We
 
delivered
 
better
 
because
 
of
 
Mark.
 
 
Mark
 
is
 
someone
 
who
 
puts
 
people
 
ﬁrst.
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
hard
 
pressed
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
count
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
times
 
I
 
saw
 
him
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
team
 
members
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
learn
 
and
 
grow
 
technically
 
and
 
professionally.
 
He
 
is
 
also
 
quick
 
to
 
give
 
thoughtful
 
feedback
 
in
 
a
 
disarming,
 
polite
 
way.
 
It’s
 
obvious
 
working
 
with
 
Mark
 
how
 
much
 
he
 
cares
 
about
 
helping
 
others.
 
 
And
 
this
 
all
 
says
 
nothing
 
of
 
his
 
technical
 
skills.
 
I’m
 
comfortable
 
saying
 
there
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
problem
 
you
 
could
 
put
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
Mark
 
that
 
he
 
couldn’t
 
ﬁgure
 
out.
 
He
 
learned
 
Ansible
 
in
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
delivering
 
on
 
a
 
SOW
 
which
 
we
 
sold
 
based
 
on
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
use
 
Ansible!
 
 
If
 
I
 
were
 
putting
 
together
 
a
 
team
 
for
 
a
 
D&A
 
project,
 
there’s
 
no
 
question
 
I’d
 
want
 
it
 
to
 
include
 
Mark.”
