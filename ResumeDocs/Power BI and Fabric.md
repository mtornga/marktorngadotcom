Power BI and Fabric Experience

Used Fabric Notebook to orchestrate data pipelines that read from a lakehouse, use an azure-hosted llm model to clean and categorize data, and write back to a new table in the database.

Used PySpark and SparkSQL for ELT jobs

Used the Power BI Admin - Get Activity Events REST API endpoint and other admin endpoints to pull user activity and content data for the purpose of building robust dashboard adoption metrics. Combined user activity data with employee roster data from Workday to roll up metrics by department, region, job title. 
Created a table of Total Addressable Market figures for each major dashboard product to measure adoption vs a specific goal. 
Created a table of Business Value Dollars per TAM clicks. The business owner of the dashboard is asked to pretend the dashboard is a SaaS we pay monthly for and they decide how much they would pay for the product ($10 per user, $50, etc). Got to a annualized revenue of $1.5m on just 5 major dashboards just 6 months after the prod release of power bi in the enterprise, not counting the myriad smaller dashboards.
Used click data, combined with fabric Compute Usage data, combined with our Fabric invoice amount, to create an analysis showing cost per user/click. This was massively useful in communicating to executives about how our Fabric program costs would scale with additional users!

Configured an app with multiple reports and audiences to carefully distribute analytics to the right people. 

Pioneered mobile phone dashboarding at COre & Main. delivered a mobile view of the Outside Sales Rep report with mobile design decisions that was extremely well-received by the OSRs. OSR input was they are often on the road and its a pain to get on their laptop and get on a hotspot to view reports and dashboards. Power BI Mobile App solved all that for them!

Used Power BI Paginated Report Builder and Power Automate as two separate solutions for generating multi-tab Excel reports from Power BI Semantic Models. 

Embedded Power BI reports in Sharepoint and Powerpoint to great effect. 

Handled the change management and project management of moving 60 MAU from ThoughtSpot to Power BI. Held dozens of demos and training sessions with small groups of users, usually a department or subdepartment, to help them get acclimated to the new BI platform and build trust in the data. Rebuilt ThoughtSpot data models into Power BI Semantic models.
