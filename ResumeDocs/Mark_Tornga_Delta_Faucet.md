FEEDBACK
Vice President of Finance @ Core & Main
"Mark and his team have successfully delivered six AI projects, becoming early adopters and educators in the field... His technical
acumen and leadership have been instrumental in our Power BI rollout. Mark has provided learning and development
opportunities for all team members, ensuring they are developing and enjoying their work."
Senior Delivery Principal @ Slalom
"You absolutely crushed it on the Security Dashboard project. To develop a board-level presentation for a $15B company in two
weeks, focused on subject matter that you were unfamiliar with, is no small feat. You have gained the trust and respect of
everyone you have worked with while also expanding your own understanding of a very complex situation and organization."
Senior Principal @ Slalom
"Mark was instrumental to the work done on the Batch Analytics project, and he was the primary driver for the additional
extension requested by the client. Time and time again Mark showed up to client meetings, navigated the complex business
challenges, and drove the conversations to a meaningful outcome. The client landscape wasn't simple, and the expectations
were high. Mark constantly adapted to the changing landscape... We were able to watch the team's backlog shrink from 23,000
active daily backlog tickets all the way down to 8k."
Senior Architect @ Slalom
"One of the most positive experiences I've had on a project. What stands out most about Mark is his poise in tough situations. His
composure under pressure translated into client confidence. Mark is someone who puts people first—I've lost count of the
number of times I saw him reach out to team members to help them learn and grow. If I were putting together a team for a D&A;
project, there's no question I'd want it to include Mark."
Global Partner Alliance Manager @ Slalom
"Mark led a weeklong analytics webinar for one of the leading companies in STL. Originally the attendance goal was
approximately 50—over 420 unique individuals attended. As a result, demand for analytics and data visualization is growing
exponentially, millions will be saved in licensing costs, and the client is beginning to get more value from its data."
Solution Owner @ Slalom
"Mark is a 'true professional'—responsible, a self-starter, and an expert in his field. He is calm and confident when asked
questions and presents material naturally and with ease. His ability to answer questions made him a favorite of our most
inquisitive client employees. He is a great team member and always willing to help someone else."
